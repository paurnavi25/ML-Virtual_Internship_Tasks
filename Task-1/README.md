Restaurant Rating Prediction – Task 1

This folder contains the work for the first internship task.  
The goal of the task was to build a machine learning model that can
predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant using the given dataset.

Work Done:
• Loaded the dataset and checked its structure.
• Cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
• Converted categorical columns into numerical values.
• Selected "Aggregate rating" as the target.
• Split the data into training and testing sets.
• Trained two models (Linear Regression and Decision Tree).
• Evaluated the models using Mean Squared Error and R² score.
• Saved the trained model
